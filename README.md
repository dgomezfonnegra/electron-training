# Desktop apps with JS & Electron

This repo exists to use some examples on the talk **Desktop apps with JS & Electron** for December 14, 2016. In here we can start from the master branch with some basic configurations or jump directly into one of the boilerplate branches with more cool things implemented.

## Branches

To use this repo with some cool examples you can jump into the following branches to see more examples of things you may need. Please note that on each branch you'll have a fully functional electron project, so perhaps you'll find things duplicated between branches.

```
keyboard-shortcuts
tray-icon
```

All examples can be found at

```
develop
```

## Installation

Just clone the repo :)...

To install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To run the app:
```
npm start
```

To build the app with the electron-builder configured already:
```
npm run build
```

## Tests

There are no test at the moment, but there are future plans to improve this repo with more cool stuffs.
